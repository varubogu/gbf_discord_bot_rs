# Poise Migration Test

## Migration Summary

The Discord bot has been successfully migrated from serenity-only to poise framework:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added poise dependency** to Cargo.toml (version 0.6)
2. **Created commands module** with three poise commands:
   - `/recruit` - Multi-battle recruitment (migrated from serenity CommandInteraction)
   - `/help` - Help information display
   - `/environ_load` - Environment reload (simplified due to Send trait issues)
3. **Refactored main.rs** to use:
   - `poise::Framework` instead of `serenity::Client`
   - `poise::FrameworkOptions` for command registration
   - Automatic global slash command registration via `poise::builtins::register_globally`
4. **Maintained existing functionality**:
   - Database integration through poise's user data system
   - Event handling for non-command events (reactions, etc.)
   - Environment initialization

### Test Results:
- ✅ Compilation successful (`cargo check` passed)
- ✅ All dependencies resolved correctly
- ⚠️ Some warnings about unused functions (expected from old serenity code)

### Key Benefits of Migration:
1. **Simplified command handling** - No need to manually parse command interactions
2. **Automatic slash command registration** - Poise handles this automatically
3. **Better error handling** - Built-in error propagation
4. **Cleaner code structure** - Commands are self-contained functions
5. **Type safety** - Compile-time parameter validation

### Testing Instructions:
1. Set required environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - `GUILD_ID`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `CONFIG_FOLDER` (optional, defaults to ".")
2. Run: `cargo run`
3. Test slash commands in Discord:
   - `/help` - Should show help message
   - `/recruit quest:"テストクエスト"` - Should create recruitment message
   - `/environ_load` - Should show implementation message

### Notes:
- The old serenity command registration system (registration.rs) is now unused but kept for reference
- Event handlers for reactions and other non-command events remain unchanged
- Database and service layers work seamlessly with the new poise structure
